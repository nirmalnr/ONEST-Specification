# Suggested Form Structure for xInput

When the Provider app sends a form to the Seeker app to get further details from the user, they can use the following `name` attributes in their `input` tags or `select` tags in their `form`. The seeker app may use this to auto fill the values from user profiles at their end.

Provider can request either a document ID or a document Name in the form. For example if the provider wants any proof of address, they will send the attribute as `proof-of-address-doc` for the file input tag in the form. The seeker can choose any proof of address document it has with them. If the provider specifically wants voter ID, then they wll send the attribute as `voter-id-doc`
